Manufactured through cutting-edge 3-D printing technology, the Robotic Arm is meticulously designed for precise movements and versatile functionality across various tasks. Computer Vision based OpenCV seamlessly interprets human gestures,providing users with an intuitive control interface for the robotic arm. This feature not only elevates human-robot interaction but also simplifies the overall control mechanism.


## Working

Computer vision has been used to detect the hand movements and gestures. In the robotic arm project, we utilize OpenCV and Python code to implement computer vision techniques for object detection and tracking. Computer vision algorithms are used to analyze the video feed from the camera mounted on the device. By using OpenCV and Python code, we can identify and track objects in real-time, enabling the robotic arm to interact with its environment.

The python code locates the finger index using mediapipe library that has handtracking module and detects whether a finger is open or closed. An array contains variables of five fingers that shows in real-time in the terminal whether a finger is open or closed : open shows ‘1’ and closed shows ‘0’. It has a 2 axis motion hence, only fingers can be open and close.

## Importance

Two-axis motion robotic arms, while simpler in design compared to more complex multi-axis robotic arms, still have a variety of real-life applications across different industries: Bomb Diffusion Sites, Pick and Place Operations, Packaging and Sorting, Assembly Operations, Inspection and Quality Control & Medical Applications as well. The versatility and precision make them valuable assets across various industries, enhancing efficiency, productivity, and safety in diverse tasks and environments.
